            Plastic collected from SSV Corwith Cramer in

        Microplastics are plastic debris pieces that are smaller 
        than five millimeters in size. They can be found in most 
        habitats on Earth as well as in the digestive tracts of many 
        marine organisms and sea birds. As more research is done 
        on this type of debris, the need for global standardization 
        of sampling methods has been recognized. Since there is no 
        single agreed-upon method for counting and weighing 
        microplastics in water samples, it is difficult to compare 
        results across studies. Although common approaches may be used, 
        most laboratories develop their own procedures for microplastic 
        sampling and processing based on factors such as budget, equipment 
        availability, labor, and the specific research questions being 
        asked. “Interlaboratory comparisons” are performed in many
         scientific fields, during which multiple labs are asked to 
         analyze identical samples in order to test their ability to produce 
         reliable and repeatable measurements; this can be a step toward 
         the development of standardized sampling methods.
