            Plastic collected from SSV Corwith Cramer in
            North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre from 1986-2008

            Microplastics are plastic debris pieces that are smaller 
            than five millimeters in size. They can be found in most 
            habitats on Earth as well as in the digestive tracts of many 
            marine organisms and sea birds. As more research is done 
            on this type of debris, the need for global standardization 
            of sampling methods has been recognized. Since there is no 
            single agreed-upon method for counting and weighing 
            microplastics in water samples, it is difficult to compare 
            results across studies. Although common approaches may be used, 
            most laboratories develop their own procedures for microplastic 
            sampling and processing based on factors such as budget, equipment 
            availability, labor, and the specific research questions being 
            asked. “Interlaboratory comparisons” are performed in many
            scientific fields, during which multiple labs are asked to 
            analyze identical samples in order to test their ability to produce 
            reliable and repeatable measurements; this can be a step toward 
            the development of standardized sampling methods.
