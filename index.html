                <p>
                    I'm currently a senior working on my Computer Science bachelors 
                    at <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I
                    have experience with Python and C++ with a good understanding of
                    Javascript. It's been a pleasure being able to work on tough projects
                    thoughout my time at University of Michigan, and having to utilize
                    skills learnt in class and out of to produce effiect results. I've
                    used Flask, React, and SQL structures to produce prototype websites and
                    have developed C++ programs optimized to work within limited runtimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've currently learnt <a href="https://deck.gl/">deck.gl</a> to produce 
                    infographic maps that can be interacted with and create different 
                    layers to display data in unique ways. For me, I'm interested in finding a
                    summer internship to expand my experience and to gain skills and meet new people.
